Help us urge Congress to maintain this vital alliance.</p>

Dear [Senator/Representative] [Last Name],

I am a proud Korean American and a concerned U.S. citizen writing to express my strong opposition to any proposal or policy that would reduce or withdraw American troops stationed in South Korea.

The U.S.â€“South Korea alliance is not only a 70-year-old partnership built on shared values, but a cornerstone of peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. The presence of U.S. forces in Korea:

- Deters North Korean aggression
- Ensures regional stability
- Honors our Korean War veterans
- Enhances global defense readiness

Withdrawing troops would embolden adversaries and undermine U.S. credibility. I urge you to stand firm in supporting continued military cooperation with South Korea, including maintaining our current troop presence.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your ZIP Code]
